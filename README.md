NodeMCU V2 &amp; V3 (LoLin) Library for Altium

NodeMCU V2 footprint based on PcbDoc from [nodemcu GitHub](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit-v1.0)
LoLin (NodeMCU V3) footprint based on NodeMCU V2 with some adjusment (+100 mil in left and right)
Plus NodeMCU V2 + V3 footprint so you can change V2 and V3 in one footprint (The size adjusted but route the net by yourself) (RSV pin in V2 and GND/VUSB pin in V3 not connected)
